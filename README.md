# ray-tracer

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/carsonclarke570/ray-tracer/blob/master/images/title.png" /></div>

A (fairly) simple raytracer based off of Peter Shirley's https://raytracing.github.io/. Written for a final project in computer graphics. This mostly exists as a sandbox for me to try implementing various ray-tracing methods.

## Installation
This project was built and developed on Windows. Nonetheless, these installation instruction should hold true for Linux.

### Prerequisites
All required packages are included with the source code or linked as git submodules. However, if you want to try to build it manually without using `cmake`, install or download the following:
* GLEW - Graphics Library Extension Wrangler
* GLFW - Graphics Library Framework
* SOIL - Simple OpenGL Image Library

### Building
In order to build the project using `cmake`, run the following from the project directory (you may need to adjust these commands for Windows):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Dependencies
* [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) - Graphics Library Extension Wrangler
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) - Graphics Library Extension Wrangler
* [SOIL](http://lonesock.net/soil.html) - Graphics Library Extension Wrangler

## Contributing
I have no plans to add contributors to this project at this time. Although I have several tabled web application and graphics programmming projects I would like help with. If that sounds interesting to you, feel free to contact me.
